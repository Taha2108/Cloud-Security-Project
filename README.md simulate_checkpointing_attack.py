## README: simulate_checkpointing_attack.py

This Python script simulates the performance impact of checkpointing on a workload. It's helpful for assessing the overhead introduced by frequent checkpoints in containerized environments.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x

**How to Run:**

1. Save the script as a Python file (**simulate_checkpointing_attack.py**).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python simulate_checkpointing_attack.py
```

**Understanding the Script:**

* The script defines two functions:
    * `perform_workload_task()`: This function simulates a time-consuming workload. You can replace it with your actual workload for more realistic simulation. 
    * `simulate_checkpointing_overhead(checkpoint_time)`: This function simulates the overhead of taking checkpoints. It introduces a delay (`checkpoint_time`) between workload executions to mimic the time spent saving the system state during checkpoints.

* The `simulate_checkpointing_overhead` function takes an argument `checkpoint_time` (in seconds) that specifies the simulated delay between checkpoints. A lower value represents more frequent checkpoints and potentially higher overhead. 

* The script includes an example usage where it calls `simulate_checkpointing_overhead` with a delay of 0.1 seconds (adjust this value for your scenario). This simulates taking checkpoints every 0.1 seconds, which might significantly impact the workload's performance.

**Expected Behavior:**

The script will continuously perform the simulated workload with the introduced delay between each iteration. This emulates the workload running within a container that experiences performance degradation due to frequent checkpoints.

**Customization:**

* You can modify the workload simulation in the `perform_workload_task` function to better represent your actual workload. 
* Adjust the `checkpoint_time` argument passed to the `simulate_checkpointing_overhead` function to control the simulated frequency of checkpoints and the expected performance impact.
