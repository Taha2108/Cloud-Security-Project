**CPU Usage Monitoring Script**

This Python script utilizes the `psutil` library to monitor your system's CPU usage and log potential anomalies. It continuously checks the CPU utilization at regular intervals and alerts you if it exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating potentially resource-intensive processes.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3 (tested with 3.6+)
* `psutil` library: Install using `pip install psutil`

**Instructions:**

1. **Save the Script:**
   Create a Python file (e.g., `cpu_monitor.py`) and paste the following code:

   ```python
   import psutil
   import time

   def monitor_cpu_usage():
       """Monitors CPU usage and logs potential anomalies."""
       cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)  # Monitor CPU usage every second
       threshold = 80  # Set a CPU usage threshold (adjust based on your system)

       if cpu_usage > threshold:
           print(f"WARNING: High CPU Usage ({cpu_usage}%) - Potential Checkpointing Activity")

   # Run the monitoring function in a loop
   while True:
       monitor_cpu_usage()
       time.sleep(5)  # Check CPU usage every 5 seconds
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and execute:

   ```bash
   python cpu_monitor.py
   ```

   The script will continuously monitor CPU usage and print warnings to the console if the threshold is exceeded.

**Customization:**

* **CPU Usage Threshold:** The `threshold` variable in the script is set to 80%. Adjust this value based on your system's typical CPU usage patterns and workload. A higher threshold might be appropriate for machines handling heavy computations.
* **Monitoring Interval:** The `time.sleep(5)` line determines how often the CPU usage is checked. You can adjust this value (in seconds) to suit your needs. A shorter interval provides more frequent updates but might incur higher overhead.

**Additional Considerations:**

* This script provides a basic monitoring mechanism. You may want to integrate it into a larger system monitoring and logging framework for more comprehensive tracking.
* The script logs warnings to the console. Explore implementing features like email notifications or storing logs in files for further analysis.
* Be cautious about setting the threshold too low, as normal system operations can sometimes trigger temporary CPU spikes.

By effectively monitoring CPU usage, you can identify potential performance bottlenecks, resource-intensive processes, and potential checkpointing activity in systems that utilize such mechanisms.
